          <h3>COVID-19 Fighters</h3>
          <p>
            <p> We are the COVID-19 Fighters. It is true that each of us is from a different country, but our goal is one and the features of our goal are clear from our name, as we strive to educate people about the correct path that they must take in these difficult circumstances that compel us to take safety precautions. The main goal of this page is to clarify some of the wrong beliefs of people and try to reduce the spread of this virus until it ends and the world returns to the peace and development that it used to be.The main tought and goal of this presentation is to give information on how we can  win over the virus and also help save lives. In this presentation we will also be providing some information on bulding immunity which is the only cure as of now</p> <p>Fighting covid-19 Team​</p>

<p> We have been using English/Allopathy medicine for many decades and allopathy though is highly popular, it has limitations when it comes to viral infections. Hence we are considering alternate medicines for increasing our immune power. It is called folk medicines or indigenous medicine. Folk medicines have been in use for many centuries till date with high success rate. Folk medicines are used to cure bacterial infections and viral infections. A coronavirus is a viral disease we thought using folk medicines would help us build our immunity to fight against this virus. </p>

            <div class="heading-line"></div>
            <p>One of the main problems that we find in our society after a survey in our locality these days is ‘FALSE INFORMATION’. There are many people who want to be updated with true news and stay safe from COVID-19. Therefore we created a webpage wherein people who would like to be updated with information. Our website also contains some tips and information on ‘How do we build our immune system’ ​

To add on, WHO (World Health Organization) has also stated that fatigue (since almost about half of humanity is under lockdown) could also be a point to worry about when it comes to strengthening your immune. As informed before, as of now, building our immune system would be the only cure. ​

            <p>Coronavirus research has been slow despite severe outbreaks of SARS-CoV (SARS, 2003) and MERS-CoV (MERS, 2012). The 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been more widespread with positive cases in 6 continents and over 150,000 deaths 
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Although these vaccines are not effective against COVID-19, vaccination against respiratory illnesses such as flu is highly recommended to protect your health
People of ALL AGES can be infected by the new coronavirus. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.</p>
